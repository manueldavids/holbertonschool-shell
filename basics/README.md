# Learn Shell Basics & GitHub

This repository serves as a personal learning log where I've practiced and documented my journey with Shell Basics and getting accustomed to GitHub's version control features.


## Why This Repository?

This repository was created as part of my commitment to:
- **Learning by Doing**: By actively using shell commands and GitHub, I've deepened my understanding of both.
- **Documentation**: Keeping a record of what I've learned helps reinforce the knowledge and serves as a reference for future projects.
- **Practice**: Regular practice with shell scripting and version control is essential for proficiency.
